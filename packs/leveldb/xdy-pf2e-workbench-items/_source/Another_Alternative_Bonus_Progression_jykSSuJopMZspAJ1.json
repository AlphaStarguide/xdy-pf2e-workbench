While ABP is used for various reasons, the most popular one is simplifying item management. Many players don't use ABP as written; they often choose to remove fundamental runes and stick to adding +1 bonuses to hit, AC, saving throws, and damage dice.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>How to Apply AABP:</strong></p>\n<p>When placing the Another Alternative Bonus Progression feat onto a character you will be be presented with three options;<br /><br /></p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.xdy-pf2e-workbench.xdy-pf2e-workbench-items.Item.jCVlhaBjUrtV1yaf]{AABP - Full}<br /><br /></p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.xdy-pf2e-workbench.xdy-pf2e-workbench-items.Item.UHuhOJfTaUyYwqo2]{AABP - Full - Delayed}</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.xdy-pf2e-workbench.xdy-pf2e-workbench-items.Item.8zZhd0sWSfIdlnVJ]{AABP - No magic}</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You can click the above effects to see the differences displayed in their descriptions, but essentially, they are the same, except that for the one that does not give spell attack scaling, which is a common addition to many people's ABP implementations. You can also use the above effects by dragging them onto any character if you accidentally delete the effects.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Some notable things, bombs are completely untouched, deadly trait scales.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Implementation Notes:</strong></p>\n<p>When using this variant in its current implementation in the PF2E system, note that the rune system is hard-coded. You need to have <a href=\"https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=738\">fundemental runes</a> on items to use <a href=\"https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=739\">property runes,</a> Therefore, if you wish to apply property runes, those items must also have fundamental runes. It's up to you how you handle this. You can either provide appropriate fundamental runes for free when a player wants to apply/etch a property rune or include the fundamental rune's price as part of the property rune's cost you can characterise this as included cost or crafting cost.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Unique Effect:</strong><br />An unintended but interesting effect of AABP is that you can still give out items as treasure with fundamental runes on them. Lower-level characters will not get the AABP bonuses, allowing you to introduce such items without worrying about overpowered bonuses. For example, you could give a level 1 character a +1 shortsword, and they would get the +1 effect. At level 2, that effect would not stack with the bonuses automatically applied by AABP, as they are item bonuses. If you like the idea of this consider using the delayed variant.<br /><br /></p>\n<p><strong>Customization:</strong></p>\n<p>You can easily and freely modify the RE's on the effects to tune them to your liking. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Feel free to provide any feedback, suggestions, or questions.
